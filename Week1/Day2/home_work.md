# Week 1, Day 2: Python Object and Data Structure Basics - Updated Homework

1. Create a dictionary called `movie_info` about your favorite movie with the following keys:
   - title
   - director
   - year
   - genre
   - rating (out of 10)

   Then, perform the following operations:
   a) Print the entire dictionary
   b) Add a new key-value pair for "actors" (value should be a list of at least 3 actors)
   c) Update the rating
   d) Print the movie title and year in a formatted string

2. Create a list of 10 numbers (include both integers and floats). Using this list, perform the following tasks:
   a) Calculate and print the sum of all numbers
   b) Find and print the maximum and minimum values
   c) Calculate and print the average of all numbers
   d) Create a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list
   e) Sort the original list in descending order and print it

3. Write a program that asks the user to input a sentence. Then:
   a) Print the number of words in the sentence
   b) Print the sentence in reverse order (words, not characters)
   c) Replace all occurrences of the letter 'a' (both lowercase and uppercase) with '@' and print the result
   d) Print a list of all unique words in the sentence (ignore case)


4. Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a person with keys for "name", "age", and "city". Include at least 5 people. Then:
   a) Print the name of the oldest person
   b) Create a list of all unique cities
   c) Calculate and print the average age of all people
   d) Print the names of all people who are above the average age

5. Bonus Challenge:
   Create a simple text-based menu system that allows the user to:
   1. Add a new person to the list of dictionaries from question 5
   2. View all people in the list
   3. Search for a person by name and display their information
   4. Exit the program

   Use a while loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.

Remember to use appropriate variable names, include comments in your code, and handle potential errors (like invalid inputs) where necessary. Test your code with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.
