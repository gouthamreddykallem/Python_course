Day 1: Introduction to Python and Setup

Write a Python program that prints the following:

Your name
Your age
Your favorite programming language (which should be Python!)
A short sentence about why you're excited to learn Python


Experiment with the print() function:

Try printing multiple items in one print statement
Print a calculation (e.g., print(5 + 3))
Print a message with both text and a number (e.g., "I am X years old")


Research and write down three interesting facts about Python that weren't covered in class.
