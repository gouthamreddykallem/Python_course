## Day 5: Advanced Visualization with Seaborn

### Daily Content (30 minutes):

1. Introduction to Seaborn
   - What is Seaborn and why use it?
   - Installing and importing Seaborn

2. Statistical Plots
   - Box plots (boxplot())
   - Violin plots (violinplot())
   - Swarm plots (swarmplot())
   - Combination plots (boxenplot(), violinplot() + swarmplot())

3. Distribution Plots
   - Histograms and KDE plots (histplot(), kdeplot())
   - Rug plots (rugplot())

4. Regression Plots
   - Scatter plots with linear regression (regplot())
   - Residual plots (residplot())

5. Heatmaps and Correlation Matrices
   - Creating heatmaps (heatmap())
   - Visualizing correlation matrices

6. Customizing Seaborn Plots
   - Changing color palettes
   - Adjusting plot styles
   - Combining with Matplotlib for further customization

### Lab Exercise (15 minutes):

Using the previous dataset:
1. Create a box plot showing the distribution by category
2. Generate a violin plot to compare distributions
3. Produce a regression plot to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables
4. Create a heatmap of the correlation matrix for numerical variables
5. Customize the appearance of each plot using Seaborn's styling options
