1. Using your dataset, create at least three different types of statistical plots (box, violin, swarm, or combinations).
2. Generate distribution plots for key numerical variables in your dataset.
3. If applicable, create regression plots to visualize relationships between variables.
4. Produce a correlation heatmap for the numerical variables in your dataset.
5. For each plot, apply customizations to enhance readability and visual appeal.
6. Write a comprehensive report that interprets all the visualizations you've created throughout the week, synthesizing the insights gained from your data analysis.

Remember to encourage students to experiment with different plot types and customizations, and to interpret their visualizations in the context of their chosen dataset.
