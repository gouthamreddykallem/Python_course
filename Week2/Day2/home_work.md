## Day 2: Inheritance and Polymorphism

1. Create a base class `Animal` with attributes `name` and `age`, and methods `speak()` and `move()`.

2. Create three subclasses: `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`. Override the `speak()` and `move()` methods for each subclass.

3. Create a `Veterinarian` class with a method `examine(animal)` that takes an `Animal` object and prints examination details based on the animal type.

4. Create a list of different animals and have a `Veterinarian` examine each of them, demonstrating polymorphism.

5. Implement a `__str__` method for the `Animal` class and its subclasses to provide a string representation of each animal.
